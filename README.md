# python-challenge

This repository is for the module 3 python challenge assignment. There is a folder for both parts of this challenge, PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains its own python script as a .py file, as well as Resource and Analysis folders which contain the input .csv files and the output .txt files, respectively.

If the repository is cloned or downloaded from this page and the file organization is maintained as it appears here, the file path commands should work properly, finding the .csv files from the Resources folders and outputting the .txt files into the Analysis folders for both PyBank and PyPoll.

Inside the `Analysis` folders, found in both `PyBank` and `PyPoll`, there is a .txt file which is exported when running the code. For testing purposes, these .txt files can be deleted, and they should be recreated identically as they appear in the repo upon running the code.

I used the Anaconda Prompt on my Windows 10 machine to run and debug my code.

## PyBank

Most of the code for PyBank was influenced by the Module 3 Day 2 activities, such as `09-Stu_ReadComicBooksCSV` and `12-Stu_CensusZip`, which detail how to set up csv reading and writing, as well as how to use row indicies to find the proper data and manipulate it. I also had some help from ChatGPT for debugging the code, as well as for the syntax on the `textfile.write` sections.
